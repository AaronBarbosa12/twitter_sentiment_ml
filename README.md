This project leverages the Twitter API to gather real-time sentiment analysis of tweets mentioning "chatgpt". Using machine learning, each tweet is analyzed for sentiment and the resulting data is stored in a feature store. The automation of this process is achieved through the use of Github actions, which also facilitates the continuous deployment of the application to a Huggingface space.
